# PLMPy CLient

PLMPy is a Python CLI tool designed to streamline interactions with a remote PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) application. The tool provides a user-friendly command-line interface to perform various tasks related to managing objects in the PLM system, such as listing objects, extracting data, and facilitating comparisons. It aims to simplify the workflow for users who need to work with PLM data without the need for complex manual operations.

## Features

- **List Objects**: Retrieve a list of objects stored in the remote PLM application. This feature allows users to quickly view and identify objects within the system.

- **Extract Data**: Extract detailed data and information from specific objects within the PLM system. This feature helps users gather the necessary information for analysis or reporting.

- **Compare Objects**: Facilitate comparisons between different objects in the PLM system. Users can easily identify differences and similarities in attributes and properties.

## Installation

To use PLM Manager, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cli.py.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd cli.py`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the PLM Manager CLI: `python cli.py.py`

## Usage

PLM Manager provides a set of commands to interact with the remote PLM application:

- To list objects: `cli.py list`
- To extract data from an object: `cli.py extract <object_id>`
- To compare objects: `cli.py compare <object_id_1> <object_id_2>`

Replace `<object_id>` with the actual identifiers of the objects you want to work with.
